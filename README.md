# Engineered

This project is a GUI for the [Pymunk](https://www.pymunk.org/) physics engine. Experiment with different objects, springs, joints and motors to explore physics concepts or simply have fun building amusing contraptions and structures. 

The user interface is built using [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/).

**Note:** I'm hoping to develop this further into a game where the user has to build a vehicle to overcome obstacle courses of increasing difficulty. But for now you just get the vehicle building stage, which is essentially a physics simulator.

## Educational Use Cases

This simulator can be a fun and powerful educational tool:
- Visualizing Newtonian physics concepts (e.g. forces, motion, energy).
- Experimenting with springs, e.g. demonstrating Hooke's law
- Demonstrating conservation laws e.g. energy, angular momentum.
- Modelling friction, elasticity and damping
- Even demonstrating statistical laws e.g. by building a Galton Board. 
- Teaching coding and physics principles together.

## Features

- **Interactive Physics**: Add, move, and modify dynamic objects in a live simulation environment.
- **Constraints System**: Connect objects with damped springs, pivot joints, and motors.
- **Object Anchoring**: Precisely control interaction points using anchor markers.
- **Static objects**: Create static objects by pinning objects to the background.
