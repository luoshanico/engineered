# Engineered
Sandbox game where player has to engineer a machine to manouvre through obstacle courses.

Initial release only contains the "build" stage, which is essentially a GUI for the Pymunk Physics module. This can be used to simulate physics experiments, or to build structures with a combination of components: ball, bar, motor, spring and other constraints.
